# Human In The Loop

This capstone setup does not allow the orchestration flow to move through major SDLC checkpoints without an explicit reviewer decision.

## Required approvals

| Gate | Reviewer focus | Expected decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `requirements-signoff` | Scope, assumptions, success criteria | Approve or request changes |
| `architecture-signoff` | Component boundaries, data flow, tech choices | Approve or request changes |
| `design-review-signoff` | Risks, gaps, mitigations | Approve or request changes |
| `implementation-signoff` | Delivered scope vs plan | Approve or request changes |
| `review-signoff` | Correctness, security, tests, clarity | Approve or request changes |
| `pr-readiness-signoff` | PR completeness and evidence | Approve or request changes |

## Operating rule

The orchestrator may prepare outputs for a stage, but a human reviewer decides whether the stage is complete. If a gate is rejected, the next step is to revise the stage output instead of advancing the workflow.

Approvals are story-scoped. A reviewer approves `stories/<story-id>/requirements.md` or `stories/<story-id>/architecture.md`, not a shared global document.

## How to use this later

1. Choose the active story in `stories/index.json` or create a new folder from `stories/_template/`.
2. Use the corresponding agent file for the active stage.
3. Ask a human reviewer to approve the output against the gate criteria.
4. Capture the decision in the related story artifact before moving on.
